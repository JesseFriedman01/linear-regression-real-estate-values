# Linear Regression- Futures real estate values

This script uses the Quandl library to retrieve data provided by Zillow, specifically "Zillow Home Value Index - All Homes", in a particular zip code. 

The scikit-learn library is then used to create a linear regression model, by which a future home value can be predicted.

Finally, all data is plotted visually using the matplotlib library.
